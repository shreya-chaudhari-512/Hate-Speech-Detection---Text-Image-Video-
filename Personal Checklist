✅ Recommended Dataset Sizes
🔹 Image Hate Detection

Total images: 8,000 – 12,000

Train: 70%

Validation: 15%

Test: 15%

Why this works:

Enough for CNN + BERT

Trains in reasonable GPU time

Easy to justify academically

📌 You can say in viva:

“A balanced subset was selected to reduce computational overhead while preserving diversity.”

🔹 Violence / Gore Detection (Frames)

Total frames: 6,000 – 10,000

Classes:

Non-violent

Violent

Gore

You do NOT need 100k frames.

🔹 Video Dataset

Videos: 150 – 300 total

Frame extraction: 1–3 FPS

This is more than enough for a college project.



2️⃣ GPU TRAINING CHECKLIST (PRINT THIS)

Use this checklist every time you go to the college GPU PC.

🔥 Before Training

✔ Dataset copied
✔ Repo pulled from GitHub
✔ Virtual environment created
✔ GPU detected (nvidia-smi)
✔ Correct CUDA version
✔ Batch size adjusted to GPU memory

🔥 During Training

✔ Train on subset first
✔ Save checkpoints every few epochs
✔ Log metrics (loss, F1)
✔ Avoid training overnight without supervision

🔥 After Training

✔ Save model weights
✔ Save confusion matrix
✔ Export logs/plots
✔ Push results to GitHub (NOT datasets)


ORDER ::
1️⃣ Finalize datasets
2️⃣ Create repo + .gitignore
3️⃣ Implement image-only pipeline
4️⃣ Test OCR + text model locally
5️⃣ Train image model on GPU
6️⃣ Extend to video
7️⃣ Add violence + gore
